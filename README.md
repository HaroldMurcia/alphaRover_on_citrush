Growing evaluation in the early stages of crop development can be critical to eventual yield. Point clouds have been used for this purpose in tasks such as detection, characterization, phenotyping, and prediction on different crops with terrestrial mapping platforms based on laser scanning. 3D model generation requires the use of specialized measurement equipment, which limits access to this technology because of their complex and high cost, both hardware elements and data processing software. An unmanned 3D reconstruction mapping system of orchards or small crops has been developed to support the determination of morphological indices, allowing the individual calculation of the height and radius of the canopy of the trees to monitor plant growth. This paper presents the details on each development stage of a low-cost mapping system, which integrates an Unmanned Ground Vehicle UGV and a 2D LiDAR to generate 3D point clouds.
